# Uri-Online-Judge-Solutions
Repository of my correct submissions from URI Online Judge.

Hello, I created this repository to save my correct submissions to the URI. I started using the platform at the beginning of the Computer Science course, **currently I have 294 problems solved out of 300 tried** (I didn't even remember those 6, let's fix it!). **I have 792 points and occupy the 34th position in the IFCE raking.**
